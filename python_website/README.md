## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+ installed on your system
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd "C:\Users\Karlos\Documents\Capstone Front-end\python_website"
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up MongoDB** (Optional but recommended):
   
   The application works with or without MongoDB:
   - **Without MongoDB**: Uses simulated sensor data (good for testing)
   - **With MongoDB**: Uses real database with persistent data
   
   **Option A: Use MongoDB Atlas (Cloud - Recommended)**
   ```bash
   python setup_mongodb.py
   ```
   Follow option 3 for cloud setup instructions.
   
   **Option B: Install MongoDB locally**
   ```bash
   python setup_mongodb.py
   ```
   Follow option 2 for local installation instructions.

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Open your web browser** and visit:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Homepage
- `GET /water-monitoring` - Water monitoring page
- `GET /feeding-systems` - Feeding systems page
- `GET /dashboard` - Dashboard page
- `GET /support` - Support page
- `GET /contact` - Contact page
- `GET /api/sensor-data` - JSON API for real-time sensor data

## Database Collections

The MongoDB database includes the following collections:

### sensor_data
- Real-time and historical sensor readings
- Fields: timestamp, ph, temperature, dissolved_oxygen, turbidity, salinity, ammonia
- Automatically populated with 7 days of sample data

### feeding_schedules  
- Daily feeding schedules and status
- Fields: date, time, amount_kg, status, tank, completed_at
- Tracks feeding history and upcoming schedules

### alerts
- System alerts and notifications
- Fields: timestamp, type, message, sensor_id, acknowledged
- Includes warnings, info, and success messages

### system_settings
- Application configuration and thresholds
- Tank settings, alert thresholds, feeding preferences
- System maintenance information

## Sample Data

When MongoDB is available, the application uses real database data:
- **With MongoDB**: 7 days of historical sensor data, real feeding schedules, system alerts
- **Without MongoDB**: Simulated real-time data for demonstration
  - pH levels (6.5 - 8.5)
  - Temperature (20°C - 30°C) 
  - Dissolved Oxygen (4 - 12 mg/L)
  - Turbidity (0 - 50 NTU)
  - Salinity (15 - 35 ppt)
  - Ammonia (0 - 5 mg/L)

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 60+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+

## Development

To modify the application:

1. **Templates**: Edit Jinja2 templates in the `templates/` directory
2. **Styling**: Modify `static/css/style.css` for custom styles
3. **Backend Logic**: Edit `app.py` for routes and data processing
4. **Dependencies**: Update `requirements.txt` as needed

## Production Deployment

For production deployment, consider:
- Using a production WSGI server (Gunicorn, uWSGI)
- Setting up a reverse proxy (Nginx, Apache)
- Configuring environment variables for sensitive settings
- Implementing proper logging and monitoring
- Setting up SSL certificates for HTTPS

## License

This project is created for demonstration purposes based on the original React frontend design.
